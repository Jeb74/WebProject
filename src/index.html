            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
                Albion Black Market is a web project with the goal of illegally trading items and currencies of
                Albion Online.<br>
                Our staff is composed of regular players. Because of this we know how much it is important to maintain the anonymity;
                this is why every transaction is anonymous until the very last moment.

            <h2>How to buy/sell?</h2>
            <p>
                In our website there are two different types of sales:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first one is the common sell-order, where the buyer has only to buy the product at the given price.</li>
                <li>The second one is the auction, where the buyer will have to check the price and try to win the product bidding the highest price
                    of all the buyers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To create a sell-order or an auction you will have to go on the section <a href="selling.html">"Selling Space"</a> and provide the information required.
                If you don't have an account on our website you will have to specify your in-game nickname for every transaction.<br>
                If you already own an account the information will be inherited from your <a href="personal_area.html">Personal Area</a> data.<br>
                To buy anything on our store you have to access the <a href="products.html">Products</a> section and chose between the various products shown.
            </p>

            <h2>What to do after buying something?</h2>
            <p>
                Once you have bought something on our store you will receive the name of the seller on our page.<br>
                When you have both received the information about each other, both of you will have to confirm that the transaction has been completed.
                Every transaction will be frozen until both the buyer and the seller will have confirmed that the transaction is ended successfully.
                That means that all the money paid will remain linked to the transaction and will not be usable for any other purchase.
