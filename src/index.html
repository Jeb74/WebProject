                        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                        <p> Albion Black Market is a web project with the goal of illegally trading items and currencies of Albion Online. <br> Our staff is composed of regular players. Because of this we know how much it is important to maintain the anonymity; this is why every transaction is completely anonymous from start to end. </p>

                        <h2>How to buy and sell?</h2>
                        <p> In our website there are two different types of sales: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first one is the common sell-order, where the buyer has only to buy the product at the given price.</li>
                            <li>The second one is the auction, where the buyer will have to bid the most of all other players in order to receive the item.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> To create a sell-order or an auction you will have to go on the section <a href="selling.html">"Selling Space"</a> and provide the information required. If you don't have an account on our website you will have to specify your in-game nickname for every transaction (using an alt-account is highly recommended). <br> If you already own an account the information will be inherited from your <a href="personal_area.html">Personal Area</a> data. <br> To buy anything on our store you have to access the <a href="products.html">Products</a> section and chose between the various products shown. </p>

                        <h2>What to do after buying something?</h2>
                        <p> After making a purchase on our store, you will receive the name of our escrow on our website. <br> All transactions will be temporarily held until both the buyer and the seller confirm a successful completion. This ensures that the funds paid are specifically tied to that transaction and cannot be used for any other purchase. Additionally, the item being sold will be temporarily held in our system until the payment is verified. </p>
